# Low-alloy-steels
The mechanical properties such as stress and strain values change as alloy content changes. Temperature influences stress and strain values. It was discovered that by varying the concentration of alloy elements and operation temperature, 2 percent proof strength, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and area reduction could be achieved. Different regression models were used to examine the variation of mechanical characteristics in relation to alloy composition and temperature separately. The random forest regressor was discovered to be the best fit model with the highest accuracy ( 99 percent ).
